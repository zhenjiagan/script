##  extract_electron_density_from_dscf_log

The main function of this python file is to extract the electron density of the corresponding atoms from the dscf.log file generated by the QM/MM calculation of chemshell+turbomole.

Run `python extract_density.py -i dscf.log -t "{66: 's', 67: 's', 68: 's', 69: 's', 70: 'ni', 71: 'fe', 72: 'fe', 73: 'fe', 74: 'fe', 75: 'o', 76: 'h', 77: 'c', 78: 'o', 79: 'o'}" -o extracted_df.log`

    -i, refers to the name of the input file
    -o, refers to the name of the input file
    -t, refers to a dictionary containing the atomic number and element name you want to extract (QM region)
